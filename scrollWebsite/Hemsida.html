                Did You Know? In the world of RPGs, your character's fate can hinge on the roll of a 20-sided die, but did you know that the iconic d20 design was not always standard? In the early days, Gary Gygax, co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons, used a 12-sided die and glued numbers on it for his first role-playing game. The shift to the now-famous 20 sides happened later, forever altering the destiny of countless imaginary heroes and villains.

                Ever wonder how RPG characters carry so much stuff? In the real world, it might be a struggle to manage a backpack, but not for our intrepid adventurers. The average RPG character can haul around tons of gear without breaking a sweat. To put it in perspective, the weight of their inventory would make even the most seasoned backpacker jealous. Forget about packing light; in the RPG realm, characters are the ultimate overburdened travelers.
